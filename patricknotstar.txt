This Spongebob Squarepants character looks almost like Patrick, but with facial hair and large eyebrows. He stars in the episode "Hide and then what happens?" Patrick-Not-Star is found at the end of the world where he tells Spongebob this line of wisdom "Games are about having fun, not about winning."
